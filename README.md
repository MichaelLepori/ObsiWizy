v1.0.5:
The previous Fix didn't work as expected.
Cause some Limitation of the OS, I had to change completely, how the Windows (and the hidden Windows) are checked.
There is now a new Option under Settings.
You can choose, to hide always Obsidian. It means when you have Obsidian under another window, Obsidian will be hidden. And then you have to click it again to show it.
Or you can choose, to move between the windows. The Problem hier is that you need to click on the Obsidian Window before you can hide it. This could be the best solution for you, if you don't use Obsidian only to read notes. If indeed you read often Notes without clicking on Obsidian, then this is also not the best Solution.
Note: When you do not click on Obsidian, you will never be able to hide it. This is the limitation of Windows, that I meant.
With this version I can tell you, that ObsiWizy is stable and works better as in the previous versions.

- Fixes
  - On Start: Now you do not see the Obsidian Window hiding anymore. That was something that I didn't like at all.

v1.0.4:
- Fixes:
  - When hidden by Startup, the Obsidian Window will not appear when the icon was clicked.

v1.0.3:
- New
  - The Program is automatically retrieving the Unique ID of the Obisidian Window. With this, if the window is open but not hidden, then it will appear. If you are looking to obsidian and then you click on the ObsiWizy icon, Obsidian will be hidden. It wasn't easy to figure it out, but now it is working as expected.

v1.0.2:
- New:
  - You can now create Links to Locale Files with Click on the ObsiWizy Icon or with **Shift + Windowskey + F**

v1.0.1:
- New:
  - You can now choose to hide Obsidian direct after starting it. Default: NoHide.

- Fixes:
  - The position of the second Window for the Title of a WikiLink was not centered.

v1.0.0: First Release with basic functions:
- Start Obsidian
- Hide Obsidian
- Maximize Obsidian
- Close ObsiWizy (and Obsidian, if you'd like)
- Start ObsiWizy and Obsidian together with Windows
- Create WikiLinks (in Clipboard to copy in your Notes)

Take care.
